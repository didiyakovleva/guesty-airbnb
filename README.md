I was asked to create a bot that exports tweets from the last 24 hours mentioning airbnb to a csv. 
And also create an app that allows user to select a city.
When making a choice, it should show a list of listings in that city. 
When clicking on a listing it should redirect to a page with the listing picture, title, address and that listing's reviews.

In this project I used angular-seed.
